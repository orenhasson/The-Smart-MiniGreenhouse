# The-Smart-MiniGreenhouse
We aimed to create a miniature greenhouse that could serve as a model for a larger one, designed to independently optimize internal conditions for specific plants (optimal conditions inserted by user). Our focus was on soil humidity, temperature, and light.

## How the system works?
The system integrates a soil humidity sensor, a temperature sensor, and WiFi to optimize the greenhouse's operation.  

- Soil Humidity Sensor:  
  The sensor is calibrated to 100% for a fully saturated soil benchmark. For a generic plant, 70% humidity is set as optimal. The sensor checks the soil every 20 seconds. If the humidity drops below 70%, irrigation activates for 20 seconds. Afterward, the sensor checks again and repeats the irrigation cycle as needed until optimal humidity is restored.  
- Temperature Sensor:  
  Mounted on the greenhouse roof, the temperature sensor triggers a fan when the temperature reaches 30Â°C or higher.  
- Lighting Control:  
  The system connects to WiFi to access real-time data and manage lighting. While primarily for convenience rather than plant health, the lights turn on at 17:00 (5 PM) and off at 23:00 (11 PM) daily.  

## How it's made?
We used a Large Ikea plastic box to portarait the grenhouse. we drilled 3 square holes in the size of 3 fans that are activated according to temperature, as shown in the following image:

In addition, there was a hole made for the temperature sensor, as the following image shows:
